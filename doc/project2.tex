\section{}

For this project, you will need to understand segments and local descriptor tables.



\subsection{Roadmap}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In src/geekos/user.c, you will implement the functions Spawn(), which starts a new user process
  \item and Switch\_To\_User\_Context(), 
		which is called by the scheduler before executing a thread in order to switch user address spaces if required.
  \item Exe\_Format data structure passed as a parameter. 
  		This data structure will be used by the Spawn() function to determine how to load the executable.
  \item In src/geekos/userseg.c, 
   		you will implement functions which provide support for the high level operations in src/geekos/user.c.
   		\subitem Destroy\_User\_Context(), frees the memory resources used by a user process
   		\subitem Load\_User\_Program() builds the User\_Context structure for a new process by loading parts of the executable program into memory.
   		\subitem xxx
\end{itemize}
