\section{The objectfile}
The objectfile is a intermediate file created by the compiler, that already
contains generated code and a lot of meta-information. The linker reads this
objectfile and creates a binaryfile. \\
The reason for that intermediate step is, that the compiler cannot read sourcecode
from imported modules at compiletime. So it just writes a reference of that modulecode
in the objectfile. The linker however can read modules compiled separately (in
objectfile format) and link that reference together with the sourcecode and
export it to a binaryfile.
