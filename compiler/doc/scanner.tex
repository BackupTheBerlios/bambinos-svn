\section{The scanner}
\label{scanner}
The scanner reads a sourcefile and returns all symbols found as tokens. The
scanner is implemented as a class that is instantiated by the parser. 
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={read a symbol}]
Scanner myScanner = new Scanner();
myScanner.importSource("filename");
	
myScanner.getSym(); 
\end{lstlisting}
This example returns one token. The valid tokens are defined in the class \emph{Ident}.
