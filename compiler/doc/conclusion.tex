\part{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
After completing this project we conclude that the main issue of creating a
compiler is planning. \\
We put a lot of effort into creating the EBNF and make is LL(1) compliant. We
believe that this kept us a from a lot of problems during code generation. We
also see that our clean design of the output files (symbolfile, objectfile,
binaryfile) and the API's to access them contributed to the success of this project.
\\ \\
The other conclusion we see is that this project helped us to understand the
funtionality of a computer. Now we can see software development from a different
perspective as we got a new (or even the first) view of code-computation. This
made us redefine our personal definition of ``good'' and ``bad'' sourcecode. 
\\ \\
So we can say that desiging and writing a compiler is a valuable experience for
every computer scientist.
